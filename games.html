                    Shagai, also known as the Mongolian anklebone game, is a traditional pastime deeply rooted in
                    Mongolian culture. Players use the anklebones of sheep or goats, known as shagai, as dice in various
                    games of skill and chance. The game involves tossing the anklebones and interpreting their positions
                    upon landing to determine scores or outcomes. Shagai holds significant cultural importance in
                    Mongolia, often played during festive occasions, gatherings, and social events, providing both
                    entertainment and a connection to the nation's nomadic heritage.</p>

                    Shatar, also known as Mongolian Chess, reigns as the pinnacle of strategic board games, demanding
                    sharp intellect, creative prowess, and enduring patience. Often dubbed an intellectual sport, it's
                    said that chess players possess longevity, though this remains unconfirmed. While its origins are
                    uncertain, hypotheses suggest Mongolian chess may have emerged during the Hunnic era or possibly
                    introduced via India and Persia in the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries. Unlike its European
                    counterpart, Mongolian chess embodies the pastoral lifestyle, eschewing themes of warfare for a
                    reflection of the peace-loving mentality of nomadic herders. Its distinctive figures include the
                    Khaan (throne-sitter), Noyon (Prince), Bers (loyal Tiger or shepherd dog), Temee (Mare-Camel and
                    child rider on a camel with two battling stallion camels), Mori (Galloping horse), Tereg
                    (Horse-drawn cart), and Khüü (Wrestling kids). </p>

            <h2>Хуруудах – Huruudakh (finger guessing game)</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <img src="path/to/your/photo3.jpg" alt="Photo 3">
                <p>This game is like the Mongolian version of rock-paper-scissors. Two people count "one, two, three"
                    and then stick out one finger each at the same time. The fingers have ranks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Thumb beats index.</li>
                    <li>Index beats middle.</li>
                    <li>Middle beats ring.</li>
                    <li>Ring beats pinky.</li>
                    <li>Pinky beats thumb.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If both players show fingers with no rank difference, they play again. To win a point, you need to
                    show a finger that beats your opponent's finger. You play to three points, and each player keeps
                    track of their points on their other hand.</p>
