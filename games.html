                <p>This game is like the Mongolian version of rock-paper-scissors. Two people count "one, two, three" and then stick out one finger each at the same time. The fingers have ranks: thumb beats index, index beats middle, middle beats ring, ring beats pinky, and pinky beats thumb. If both players show fingers with no rank difference, they play again. To win a point, you need to show a finger that beats your opponent's finger. You play to three points, and each player keeps track of their points on their other hand.</p>

                <p> The horse race version of the Mongolian ankle bone game shagai is a fun and competitive game that simulates a horse race using ankle bones. Here's how it's played:

                    Setup: Players gather a set of four ankle bones (shagai) and arrange them in a line to represent horses lined up at a starting point.
                    
                    Player Turns: Players take turns flicking or tossing their ankle bones towards a finish line. The order of turns is usually determined randomly or by mutual agreement.
                    
                    Movement: Each ankle bone represents a horse. When a player flicks or tosses their ankle bone, it moves forward based on the result of the flick. The distance moved can depend on factors like the force of the flick and the angle at which the bone lands.
                    
                    Scoring: The first ankle bone to cross the finish line wins the race. Players can establish specific rules for scoring, such as assigning points based on the order in which the ankle bones cross the finish line.
                    
                    Strategy: Players can employ various flicking techniques and strategies to try to advance their ankle bones quickly while hindering the progress of opponents' ankle bones.
                    
                    Multiple Rounds: Players can play multiple rounds of the horse race game to determine an overall winner.
                    
                    Variations: There can be variations in the setup, rules, and scoring of the game based on preferences and local customs. For example, players might introduce obstacles or challenges on the track to add complexity to the race.
                    
                    Overall, the horse race version of shagai is an exciting and competitive game that combines skill, strategy, and luck as players race their ankle bones towards the finish line.</p>
