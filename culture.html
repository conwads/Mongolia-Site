                <p>All ger doors face down south towards China. Looking down on them. 
                    If you go to a ger that had nobody, you can make yourself some food just be sure to clean up and leave a gift
                    Hedgehog spikes on door - no bad spirits or mean things in home
                    Person entering has to come in the ger first.
                    Don't trip when you leave the house come back and put wood in the stove if you do. 
                    Don't put cup on bed
                    “Within the ger, the two supports in the centre of the ger provide stability to the ger. Tradition forbids passing anything through them or leaning against them. Don’t put rubbish directly onto the fire in the stove – fire is sacred.”
                    
                    https://www.mongolia-trips.com/travel-tips/nomadic-life-traditions/customs-taboos-mongolia
                    
                    To lean back against the yurt’s posts or to pass through them. This custom probably has practical origins but also expresses the symbolism of the posts as fonts of strength in the house.
                    To walk on the doorway. It is ominous to walk or stumble over the yurt’s doorway when you go inside. In the Middle Ages, the travellers who went to Mongolia told that anyone who walked over the yurt’s doorway was executed.
                    To stretch out the arms in order to touch the two sides of the doorframe. This would represent a cross, and a cross outside the yurt’s door traditionally means that someone is dead and that the visitors must keep their distance. So touching the two sides of the doorframe is regarded as a bad omen.
                    To throw some wastes in the stove. The fire is considered as the purest element and no waste must be thrown in it.
                    To mix dirty things and clean things. Mongolian people have a great esteem for cleanliness and they think that if dirty things touch clean things, they will contaminate them. Thus, in accordance with this custom, it would be intolerable to put dirty clothes in the family chest.
                    To walk or sit North of a person older than oneself. Although Mongolians believe in Confucianism with less strength than other Asian people, the elders are given considerable respect. The oldest and most respected visitors sit in the bottom of the yurt, and the other ones sit on the sides, from the oldest one to the youngest one.
                    To walk between the fire and the bottom of the yurt because they are the two most sacred parts of the yurt. Nomads believe that energy passes between these two points and that we must not cut it off. So the visitors must go in and go out by the same side.
                    To walk anti-clockwise. The “nar zuv”, literally “the good sense”, refers to clockwise. Mongolians think that everything in the universe belongs to the cycles of time and movement, so it’s important to mode in harmony with these cycles. For example, when we fold down the roof of the yurt, we must do it walking clockwise outside the yurt.
                    To bring weapons in the yurt. Before going in the yurt, the visitor must remove the knife from his belt and hang it in plain view to prove his friendly intentions.
                    Other customs rule the way guests are welcomed. Mongolians generally show great respect towards visitors and will house anyone with no preliminary appointment. When a visitor arrives, he must say “nokhoi khor!” which means, “hold your dog!” even if there’s no dog, in order to make a member of the family go out from the yurt and invite you to go in. The three main types of welcoming are tsailaga, budaalaga, and dailaga, literally “offering tea”, “offering rice”, and “offering dinner”. Tsailaga is the most frequent one: when nomads have just set up camp and want to meet their new neighbours, for example. Budaalaga and dailaga are similar but show a bigger respect for the visitor.

                    Don't hand something behind your back to someone who's behind you. It means you think they're below you.  
                    Never use bathroom in river or lake. Those are sacred places

                    Dont put the cup on the bed
                    Never whistle inside a home/building.
                    If you step on someone’s foot - shake their hand or apologize 
                    It is polite to always grab everything that it's offered to you with 2 hands weather it be food or gifts, or even personal possessions.
                    Гараа ардаа тулах - dont put your hand on the ground behind you if you're sitting. 
                    Don't do push ups after you study, all the things you learn will leave you 
                    Don't put blood or milk in the river = sin

                    Don't walk with things between you with a friend.

                    Water kingdom, they dont take fish because its its own ecosystem and they respect it. If they did they would take it after praying and they had no food. Same with berries. Dont take the plant just the berries 
                    If you’re sitting with your legs outstretched, bring them in rather than let people walk over them. Try not to point your feet towards other people or important items such as the fire or family altar. Although there is no definite reason, it is believed that the head is the most sacred part of the body so the feet must be the dirtiest. 
                    
                    Try not to touch a hat belonging to someone else. A hat should not be placed on the floor as it is an honoured possession and a very personal item.
                    Try not to touch someone with your foot. The thinking behind this is that you have invaded their social space and you may create bad feelings. If you do touch someone’s foot, you can balance this out by shaking that person’s hand so that they know you did not mean it. The same applies everywhere in Mongolia – whether that be on a bus, in a bar or a ger. 
                    
                    Biggest unwritten law is - nothing is just mine - no mini only manai. All one big people or family

                    Mongolians didn't eat veggies. They had just meat amd milk. They also had berries in the mountains 
                    Chingis khans soldires were great because they never drank and had great health. Chingis khan never drank tea. It came from china later

                    Back in chinigis khaan time - if you washed clothes in the river they would cut off your head.
