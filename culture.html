                <h3>Holidays</h3>
                <img src="images/naadam.JPG" alt="Holiday">
                <p>Наадам – “Naadam” is a traditional festival celebrated in Mongolia, primarily known for its focus on
                    the "three manly games": horse racing, archery, and wrestling. The festival typically takes place in
                    July, and it holds significant cultural and historical importance in Mongolia, dating back centuries
                    to the time of the Mongol Empire. Naadam is not just a sporting event; it's also a celebration of
                    Mongolian identity, heritage, and nomadic lifestyle. The festival brings together people from all
                    over Mongolia, showcasing their skills in these traditional sports, along with cultural
                    performances, parades, and ceremonies.</p>

                <p>цагаан сар – “Tsaagan Sar”, also known as "White Moon" or "White Month," marks the Mongolian Lunar
                    New Year. It usually falls in late January or early February, depending on the lunar calendar.
                    Tsaagan Sar is one of the most important holidays in Mongolia, celebrated with various rituals,
                    customs, and festivities. Families gather to pay respects to their elders, exchange gifts, and share
                    traditional foods. It's a time for renewal, as people bid farewell to the old year and welcome the
                    new one with hopes for prosperity, happiness, and good fortune. Tsaagan Sar is deeply rooted in
                    Mongolian culture and reflects the country's nomadic heritage, emphasizing the importance of family,
                    community, and tradition.</p>

                <p>Битүүн - “Bituun”, also known as Bituun Tsagaan Sar or "Eve of White Moon," is an important part of
                    the Tsaagan Sar (Mongolian Lunar New Year) celebrations. Bituun is observed on the day preceding the
                    first day of the Lunar New Year, marking the end of the old year. It is a time for families to come
                    together, make final preparations for the new year, and bid farewell to the past year. During
                    Bituun, Mongolian families traditionally clean and decorate their homes meticulously. This cleaning
                    ritual symbolizes the purification of the household and the removal of any misfortunes or negative
                    energies from the previous year. It is believed that starting the new year with a clean and
                    organized home brings good luck and prosperity for the year ahead.</p>

                <p>Шинэ жил – “New Years” New Year's Day, as celebrated according to the Gregorian calendar on January
                    1st, is observed much like in other parts of the world. While it doesn't hold the same level of
                    cultural and traditional significance as Tsaagan Sar, it is still recognized and celebrated,
                    especially in urban areas and among younger generations influenced by Western culture. On New Year's
                    Eve, many Mongolians participate in various festivities such as parties, concerts, and fireworks
                    displays. Families and friends often gather to celebrate together, enjoying special meals and
                    exchanging gifts. The atmosphere is festive, with streets adorned with decorations, lights, and
                    music adding to the celebratory ambiance.</p>

                    <h4>Mongolian Food Customs and Cuisine</h4>
            
                    <h5>Types of Mongolian Food:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Meat Dishes:</strong> Mongolian cuisine is heavily centered around meat, particularly mutton, beef, and horse meat. Traditional dishes include Khuushuur (deep-fried meat dumplings), Khorkhog (meat stew cooked with hot stones), and Boodog (whole goat or marmot cooked with hot stones from the inside).</li>
                        <li><strong>Dairy Products:</strong> Nomadic herders in Mongolia rely on dairy products as essential parts of their diet. These include Airag (fermented mare's milk), Suutei Tsai (salted milk tea), and Aaruul (dried curd snacks).</li>
                        <li><strong>Bread and Grains:</strong> While not as prevalent as meat and dairy, bread and grains are still consumed in Mongolian cuisine. Traditional bread varieties include Boortsog (deep-fried dough) and Tsagaan Idee (white food), which is made from flour, water, and salt, and often served during Tsaagan Sar (Mongolian Lunar New Year).</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h5>Mongolian Food Customs:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sharing Shoulder Blade Meat: While eating, Mongolians often share the shoulder blade meat and then break the bone afterward, as it is believed to ward off evil spirits. Shamans sometimes use the shoulder bone as a "magic mirror" during rituals.</li>
                        <li>Buuz and Good Luck: Eating Buuz (steamed dumplings filled with meat) is considered auspicious, especially if you find a coin in one of them, which is believed to bring good luck.</li>
                        <li>Choking on Someone's Food: According to superstition, if you start choking after eating someone's food, it is believed that they didn't want you to eat their food.</li>
                        <li>Spilling Milk or Salt: If you spill milk, it is customary to put some on your head. Similarly, if you spill salt, rubbing it until it goes away is believed to remove bad luck.</li>
                        <li>Receiving Food or Beverages: Always receive food or beverages given to you with two hands as a sign of respect and gratitude.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h5>Tsaagan Idee (White Food):</h5>
                    <p>Tsaagan Idee, or "White Food," is a traditional Mongolian dish made from flour, water, and salt. It is often served during Tsaagan Sar (Mongolian Lunar New Year) celebrations and symbolizes purity, renewal, and prosperity for the upcoming year.</p>

                        <li>Do not bring weapons into the ger; friendly intentions are signaled by removing knives from

                <h3>Etiquette</h3>
                <p>Ёс - etiquette</p>

                <p>Etiquette/Manners</p>
                <img src="images/smile.jpg" alt="smile">

                <p>Every country possesses its own unique culture, customs, traditions, and etiquette, and Mongolia is
                    certainly no exception. Deeply ingrained within Mongolian society is a rich tapestry of traditions
                    and customs that span back hundreds of years. By gaining a better understanding of what influences
                    the day-to-day actions of a country's people, you can develop a greater appreciation for that
                    nation, and in turn, they will value the time you spent preparing.</p>

                <p>This section will focus on what I refer to as the "Do’s and Don’ts of Mongolian culture." This
                    information aims to enhance your etiquette skills and manners. Mongolians sometimes characterize
                    etiquette as the "unwritten law," signifying that it's something people practice without explicitly
                    discussing it. Armed with the knowledge of this "unwritten law," your efforts are likely to be
                    rewarded.</p>

                <p> Word: Ёс Meaning: Etiquette </p>

                <p>Don't point the sole of your foot at someone, touch the sole of your foot to another person's foot,
                    or tickle someone's foot. If you accidentally tap or step on someone's foot in public, on the bus,
                    or in a ger, ensure that you shake their hand and apologize. Alternatively, gently grabbing their
                    arm or patting them while apologizing works too if you're in a hurry. The reasoning behind this is
                    that you have invaded a person's social space, and you may have created negative feelings or energy.
                    If you do touch someone's foot, balance this out by shaking their hand to convey that it was
                    unintentional. </p>

                <p>Books:
                    Don't place books, bags, or most objects on the ground. The ground is considered dirty, and if you
                    put your personal items on the ground, you might receive confused stares. Placing books on the
                    ground is frowned upon because books are a source of knowledge and are seen as almost sacred. Doing
                    so would be disrespectful, as it may be perceived as desecrating something sacred.</p>

                <p>Bags:
                    Avoid placing any bags or personal belongings on the ground. This aligns with the etiquette related
                    to books, although not for the same respectful reasons, but simply because the ground is considered
                    dirty. Additionally, when leaving a home, avoid wearing your bag on your shoulder. Instead, hold it
                    at your side with your hand. Wearing your bag on your body when exiting a home may give the
                    impression that you could be stealing something, and people may find it inappropriate.</p>

                <p>Gifts, Receiving things, Hands.
                    It is very polite to always grab everything that it's offered to you with two hands rather than one.
                    This can be applied when receiving food, drink, books, personal possessions, or gifts from someone.
                    To express respect when receiving something, reach out your right hand while supporting your right
                    elbow with your left hand or use both hands. Even if you're presented with something you may not
                    desire, it is anticipated that you accept it and, at the very least, feign an attempt to partake.
                    Rejecting or pushing away an offered item is considered a serious violation of etiquette.</p>
