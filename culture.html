                <h3>Gers</h3>
                <p>All ger doors face down south towards China. Looking down on them.
                    If you go to a ger that had nobody, you can make yourself some food just be sure to clean up and
                    leave a gift
                    Hedgehog spikes on door - no bad spirits or mean things in home
                    Person entering has to come in the ger first.
                    Don't trip when you leave the house come back and put wood in the stove if you do.
                    Don't put cup on bed
                    “Within the ger, the two supports in the centre of the ger provide stability to the ger. Tradition
                    forbids passing anything through them or leaning against them. Don’t put rubbish directly onto the
                    fire in the stove – fire is sacred.”

                    https://www.mongolia-trips.com/travel-tips/nomadic-life-traditions/customs-taboos-mongolia

                    To lean back against the yurt’s posts or to pass through them. This custom probably has practical
                    origins but also expresses the symbolism of the posts as fonts of strength in the house.
                    To walk on the doorway. It is ominous to walk or stumble over the yurt’s doorway when you go inside.
                    In the Middle Ages, the travellers who went to Mongolia told that anyone who walked over the yurt’s
                    doorway was executed.
                    To stretch out the arms in order to touch the two sides of the doorframe. This would represent a
                    cross, and a cross outside the yurt’s door traditionally means that someone is dead and that the
                    visitors must keep their distance. So touching the two sides of the doorframe is regarded as a bad
                    omen.
                    To throw some wastes in the stove. The fire is considered as the purest element and no waste must be
                    thrown in it.
                    To mix dirty things and clean things. Mongolian people have a great esteem for cleanliness and they
                    think that if dirty things touch clean things, they will contaminate them. Thus, in accordance with
                    this custom, it would be intolerable to put dirty clothes in the family chest.
                    To walk or sit North of a person older than oneself. Although Mongolians believe in Confucianism
                    with less strength than other Asian people, the elders are given considerable respect. The oldest
                    and most respected visitors sit in the bottom of the yurt, and the other ones sit on the sides, from
                    the oldest one to the youngest one.
                    To walk between the fire and the bottom of the yurt because they are the two most sacred parts of
                    the yurt. Nomads believe that energy passes between these two points and that we must not cut it
                    off. So the visitors must go in and go out by the same side.
                    To walk anti-clockwise. The “nar zuv”, literally “the good sense”, refers to clockwise. Mongolians
                    think that everything in the universe belongs to the cycles of time and movement, so it’s important
                    to mode in harmony with these cycles. For example, when we fold down the roof of the yurt, we must
                    do it walking clockwise outside the yurt.
                    To bring weapons in the yurt. Before going in the yurt, the visitor must remove the knife from his
                    belt and hang it in plain view to prove his friendly intentions.
                    Other customs rule the way guests are welcomed. Mongolians generally show great respect towards
                    visitors and will house anyone with no preliminary appointment. When a visitor arrives, he must say
                    “nokhoi khor!” which means, “hold your dog!” even if there’s no dog, in order to make a member of
                    the family go out from the yurt and invite you to go in. The three main types of welcoming are
                    tsailaga, budaalaga, and dailaga, literally “offering tea”, “offering rice”, and “offering dinner”.
                    Tsailaga is the most frequent one: when nomads have just set up camp and want to meet their new
                    neighbours, for example. Budaalaga and dailaga are similar but show a bigger respect for the
                    visitor.

                <h3>Etiquette</h3>
                <p>Ёс - etiquette</p>

                <p>Etiquette/Manners</p> 
                <p>Every country possesses its own unique culture, customs, traditions, and etiquette, and Mongolia is
                    certainly no exception. Deeply ingrained within Mongolian society is a rich tapestry of traditions
                    and customs that span back hundreds of years. By gaining a better understanding of what influences
                    the day-to-day actions of a country's people, you can develop a greater appreciation for that
                    nation, and in turn, they will value the time you spent preparing.</p> 

                <p>This section will focus on what I refer to as the "Do’s and Don’ts of Mongolian culture." This
                    information aims to enhance your etiquette skills and manners. Mongolians sometimes characterize
                    etiquette as the "unwritten law," signifying that it's something people practice without explicitly
                    discussing it. Armed with the knowledge of this "unwritten law," your efforts are likely to be
                    rewarded.</p>

                <p> Word: Ёс Meaning: Etiquette </p>

                <p>Don't point the sole of your foot at someone, touch the sole of your foot to another person's foot,
                    or tickle someone's foot. If you accidentally tap or step on someone's foot in public, on the bus,
                    or in a ger, ensure that you shake their hand and apologize. Alternatively, gently grabbing their
                    arm or patting them while apologizing works too if you're in a hurry. The reasoning behind this is
                    that you have invaded a person's social space, and you may have created negative feelings or energy.
                    If you do touch someone's foot, balance this out by shaking their hand to convey that it was
                    unintentional. </p>

                <p>Books:
                    Don't place books, bags, or most objects on the ground. The ground is considered dirty, and if you
                    put your personal items on the ground, you might receive confused stares. Placing books on the
                    ground is frowned upon because books are a source of knowledge and are seen as almost sacred. Doing
                    so would be disrespectful, as it may be perceived as desecrating something sacred.</p>

                    <p>Bags:
                    Avoid placing any bags or personal belongings on the ground. This aligns with the etiquette related
                    to books, although not for the same respectful reasons, but simply because the ground is considered
                    dirty. Additionally, when leaving a home, avoid wearing your bag on your shoulder. Instead, hold it
                    at your side with your hand. Wearing your bag on your body when exiting a home may give the
                    impression that you could be stealing something, and people may find it inappropriate.</p>

                    <p>Gifts, Receiving things, Hands.
                    It is very polite to always grab everything that it's offered to you with two hands rather than one.
                    This can be applied when receiving food, drink, books, personal possessions, or gifts from someone.
                    To express respect when receiving something, reach out your right hand while supporting your right
                    elbow with your left hand or use both hands. Even if you're presented with something you may not
                    desire, it is anticipated that you accept it and, at the very least, feign an attempt to partake.
                    Rejecting or pushing away an offered item is considered a serious violation of etiquette.</p>

                <p>FЁс - etiquette

                    Dont walk around an object and seperate when walking with someone. Stick with them. If you do then

                    When you take nap or sleep your feet should always point south. Head should be at the north side or
                    head side
                    Don't hand something behind your back to someone who's behind you. It means you think they're below
                    you.
                    Never use bathroom in river or lake. Those are sacred places
                    Dont sing in the bed - your mom will die
                    Dont chew on anything around your neck or your mom will die
                    Dont wistle in the home - home will be destroyed
                    Dont put the cup on the bed
                    Never whistle inside a home/building.
                    If you step on someone’s foot - shake their hand or apologize
                    It is polite to always grab everything that it's offered to you with 2 hands weather it be food or
                    gifts, or even personal possessions.
                    Гараа ардаа тулах - dont put your hand on the ground behind you if you're sitting.
                    Don't do push ups after you study, all the things you learn will leave you
                    Don't put blood or milk in the river = sin
                    Don't put your foot and someone's foot. Bare food sole of foot on foot
                    Don't sit on table - be in debt.
                    Don't clip nails at night.
                    No haircut at night. Must be before sunset.
                    Don't walk with things between you with a friend.
                    Don’t scratch or tickle the palms of someone's hand.
                    Sniff cheeks and head of people you love
                    Water kingdom, they dont take fish because its its own ecosystem and they respect it. If they did
                    they would take it after praying and they had no food. Same with berries. Dont take the plant just
                    the berries
                    If you’re sitting with your legs outstretched, bring them in rather than let people walk over them.
                    Try not to point your feet towards other people or important items such as the fire or family altar.
                    Although there is no definite reason, it is believed that the head is the most sacred part of the
                    body so the feet must be the dirtiest.

                    Try not to touch a hat belonging to someone else. A hat should not be placed on the floor as it is
                    an honoured possession and a very personal item.
                    Try not to touch someone with your foot. The thinking behind this is that you have invaded their
                    social space and you may create bad feelings. If you do touch someone’s foot, you can balance this
                    out by shaking that person’s hand so that they know you did not mean it. The same applies everywhere
                    in Mongolia – whether that be on a bus, in a bar or a ger.

                    Biggest unwritten law is - nothing is just mine - no mini only manai. All one big people or family
